Based on this project #codebase The overall system is JunkHop where users can use this web application to check for junkshop that is registered on their local baranggay and have easy access what junkshop offers to ease the retrieval and selling of the items that the resident want to sell to the junkshop. With this system, baranggay official are the admins (Baranggay\_admin) where they are the one accepts/approve listing of their junkshop to verify.

For you what other functionality can be implemented on this system. As for our team we are currently thinking about using this platform to bridge the gap between merchants that who are currently looking for materials that can also be found in the junkshop, as this also align in the SDG. For context this project is based in Philippines.

**JunkHop Enhancement Opportunities**

Based on your current system, I can see that JunkHop effectively connects residents with junkshops to manage recyclable materials. Your idea to bridge the gap between merchants looking for specific materials and junkshops is excellent and aligns well with sustainability goals. Here are some functionalities that could enhance your platform:

**Merchant-Focused Enhancements**

1. **Material Marketplace**
   1. Allow merchants to create profiles specifying materials they regularly need
   1. Implement a "wanted materials" section where merchants post specific requirements
   1. Add price bidding functionality where merchants can offer competitive rates for bulk materials
1. **Inventory Visibility System**
   1. Enable junkshops to list their current inventory with quantities
   1. Implement real-time updates as materials are bought and sold
   1. Create notifications for merchants when desired materials become available
1. **Quality Verification**
   1. Add a grading system for materials (A/B/C grade plastics, metals, etc.)
   1. Allow photo uploads of materials to verify quality
   1. Implement a verification process for high-value transactions

**Community and Economic Impact Features**

1. **Community Collection Drives**
   1. Tools to organize neighborhood collection events
   1. Leaderboards for barangays/areas with highest collection rates
   1. Public impact metrics showing environmental benefits
1. **Microentrepreneur Support**
   1. Support informal waste collectors by allowing them to register and find junkshops offering best rates
   1. Provide simple bookkeeping tools for waste collectors
   1. Educational content on material sorting and pricing
1. **Value-Added Processing Guidance**
   1. Information on simple processing steps to increase material value (cleaning, sorting, compacting)
   1. Connect micro-entrepreneurs with tools/equipment suppliers

**Technical Enhancements**

1. **Material Tracking System**
   1. QR code generation for tracking materials from collection to processing
   1. Chain-of-custody documentation for corporate sustainability reporting
   1. Calculate and display environmental impact metrics (CO2 saved, landfill space preserved)
1. **Price Discovery and Analytics**
   1. Market price trends for different materials
   1. Price comparison tools across junkshops
   1. Predictive analytics for price fluctuations
1. **Integration with Manufacturing Systems**
   1. API connections to inventory management systems
   1. Regular procurement scheduling for manufacturers
   1. Bulk order management with multiple junkshops

This approach would create a complete circular economy ecosystem, providing value to residents, junkshop owners, informal collectors, and manufacturers—perfectly aligned with SDGs while addressing the unique waste management challenges in the Philippines.

**Impact Assessment for Implementing Merchant-Focused Enhancements**

Based on your existing codebase, implementing the merchant features I suggested would require moderate to significant changes, but can be approached incrementally. Here's an assessment of the impact:

**Database Schema Changes (Moderate Impact)**

\- New tables: merchants, wanted\_materials, material\_grades, bids, transactions

\- Modified tables: junkshop\_items (add quantity, grade, price fields)

\- New relationships between existing tables

Your existing Junkshop model already handles relationships (like with JunkshopItem), so the foundation exists for expansion.

**Backend API Changes (Moderate to High Impact)**

\- New controllers for merchant functionality (5-7 new controllers)

\- Extend JunkshopController.php to handle inventory quantities

\- Create notification service for inventory alerts

\- Add bidding/transaction API endpoints

The good news is your Laravel backend is already structured with controllers like [JunkshopController.php] that handle CRUD operations, so you have the pattern to follow.

**Frontend Component Changes (High Impact)**

\- New merchant dashboard views

\- Material marketplace components

\- Bidding interface components

\- Inventory management enhancements

\- Analytics visualizations

This would be the most significant change as you'd need several new Vue components and pages. Your current components like [admin_panel_junkshop_table.vue][JunkshopController.php] provide a good template to follow.

**Authentication/Authorization Impact (Low to Moderate)**

\- Add merchant role to existing role system

\- Create permission sets for merchants

Your current role-based access system appears well-structured, making this a relatively low-impact change.

**Incremental Implementation Plan**

To minimize disruption, I recommend an incremental approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Add merchant user roles and enhance junkshop inventory tracking (quantities)
1. **Phase 2**: Build basic material marketplace with wanted listings
1. **Phase 3**: Implement bidding system and transaction tracking
1. **Phase 4**: Add quality verification features
1. **Phase 5**: Build analytics and reporting features

**Scope Estimate**

\- New API endpoints: ~15-20

\- New database tables: ~5-7

\- New Vue components: ~15-20

\- Modified existing components: ~10-15

\- Backend services: ~5-7 new services

Each phase could be implemented in 2-4 weeks with a small team (2-3 developers), allowing you to release features gradually while maintaining the existing system's stability.

This approach would allow you to validate the merchant-focused features with users while spreading development effort over time.

# **Algorithm Recommendation for JunkHop System**
For your Software Engineering 2 requirement to implement an algorithm, I recommend a **Material Matching Algorithm** that would directly support your goal of connecting merchants with junkshops.
## **Recommended Algorithm: Bipartite Graph Matching with Preference Weights**
This algorithm would efficiently match merchants seeking materials with junkshops that have those materials available, considering multiple factors like:

- Material type and quality
- Price preferences
- Distance/location
- Quantity available/needed
### **How the Algorithm Works**
1. **Build a bipartite graph**:
   1. One set of nodes represents merchants with material needs
   1. Second set represents junkshops with available materials
   1. Edges between nodes represent potential matches with weights
1. **Calculate edge weights** based on:
   1. Material match score
   1. Price compatibility
   1. Distance proximity
   1. Quantity fulfillment percentage
1. **Apply the Hungarian algorithm** (also called the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm) to find the optimal assignment that maximizes the total matching score
### **Implementation Requirements**
#### *Database Changes (Minimal)*
\- Add preference fields to merchant profiles

\- Add material quality grading to junkshop inventory
#### *New Classes/Components*
\- MatchingService class to handle the algorithm logic

\- Recommendation controller to expose the API

\- Material compatibility matrix configuration
#### *Frontend Components*
\- Match recommendations display on merchant dashboard

\- Match settings configuration interface
### **Sample Pseudocode for Core Algorithm**

```python
def calculate_match_score(merchant, junkshop_item):
    # Base score for material type match
    score = 0
    if merchant.wanted_material_type == junkshop_item.material_type:
        score += 50

    # Price compatibility (closer to merchant's ideal price = higher score)
    price_diff = abs(merchant.desired_price - junkshop_item.price)
    price_score = max(0, 20 - (price_diff / merchant.desired_price) * 20)
    score += price_score

    # Distance factor (closer = higher score)
    distance = calculate_distance(merchant.location, junkshop_item.junkshop.location)
    distance_score = max(0, 20 - (distance / 10) * 20)  # 10km reference distance
    score += distance_score

    # Quantity match (closer to needed amount = higher score)
    if junkshop_item.quantity >= merchant.desired_quantity:
        quantity_score = 10
    else:
        quantity_score = (junkshop_item.quantity / merchant.desired_quantity) * 10
    score += quantity_score

    return score

def find_optimal_matches(merchants, junkshop_items):
    # Create cost matrix (negative scores since Hungarian algorithm minimizes cost)
    cost_matrix = []
    for merchant in merchants:
        row = []
        for item in junkshop_items:
            row.append(-calculate_match_score(merchant, item))
        cost_matrix.append(row)

    # Apply Hungarian algorithm
    row_ind, col_ind = hungarian_algorithm(cost_matrix)

    # Return matched pairs
    matches = []
    for i, j in zip(row_ind, col_ind):
        if cost_matrix[i][j] < 0:  # Only include if there's a positive match score
            matches.append((merchants[i], junkshop_items[j], -cost_matrix[i][j]))

    return matches

```

This algorithm would be straightforward to implement and would significantly enhance your platform's value by efficiently connecting merchants with junkshops. It's also a nice showcase for a Software Engineering 2 assignment as it demonstrates solving a real business problem with an established algorithm.
